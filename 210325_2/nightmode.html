        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
        ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
        curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] JavaScript enables
        interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for
        client-side page behavior,[11] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
        It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
        data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other runtime
        systems, such as Node.js and Deno. These systems are used to build servers and are also integrated into
        frameworks, such as Electron and Cordova, for creating a variety of applications.
